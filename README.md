# reactjs-beer-shop

 Hello, I have created this beautiful project using React as an internship assignment. In this web app an user can add beer to Favorites and can see various beers that are earlier favorited by user and   I enjoyed while creating this project as I learned many new things while creating this project and deploying the web app online.

 My approach for this project was:-
1. Create frontend of the website form using html, css and reactjs.
2. Make the form responsive so that it does not get distorted in any device.
3. Added all the functionality as stated in the assignment.

How to run the application locally 
1. clone repository on local machine.
2. run command npm i in folder.
3. run command npm start.
